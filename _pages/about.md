I am currently working as a Graduate Scientist within the Molecular AI department at AstraZeneca.  My research is focussed on applications of deep generative machine learning models to drug discovery and workflow automation in commputational chemistry.

Before joining AstraZeneca, I studied chemistry at Imperial College London, graduating with a MChem in August 2020.
